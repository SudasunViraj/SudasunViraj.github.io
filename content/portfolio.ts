As Senior QA Engineer at Modernie Business Solutions, I owned building that capability from scratch, on the same platform whose security posture I test (next project).",
    approach:
      "I designed and built the automation framework end-to-end on Playwright and TypeScript with a Cucumber BDD layer, so scenarios read as business-legible specifications while executing as fast, reliable browser automation. I fold agentic AI into day-to-day QA work — test design, coverage analysis, and suite maintenance — and complement functional automation with Apache JMeter load/stress testing and a security-aware testing lens appropriate to the FinTech domain.",
    result:

      "The same CDB DigiApp platform — an HR / workforce-management web application built as a React SPA over a Firebase REST API — holds real employee PII. As part of my end-to-end QA ownership of the platform at Modernie, I run its security testing: automated scanning alone was producing alarming but unvetted output, and the sensitivity of the data meant both false alarms and missed access-control flaws carried real cost.",
    approach:
      "I ran authenticated OWASP ZAP scans as a deliberately low-privilege user, then reconciled every black-box finding against the API's own OpenAPI specification. The scanner's loudest alerts — a cluster of apparent file disclosures (/.env, /.git/config, an /auth/dev-login endpoint) — traced back to the SPA's catch-all route serving the homepage on every path: the entire cluster collapsed to zero real issues under triage. That same reconciliation surfaced what the automated pass under-weighted: a broken-access-control (BOLA) flaw allowing a plain user token to read other employees' HR records and the org-wide audit log, and an inconsistent-authorization pattern where the same resource was protected on one HTTP verb and wide open on another. I delivered each cycle as a dated regression suite and re-verified the open access-control findings against live data on every redeployment.",
    result:
      "The team remediated the hardening-tier findings (frontend security headers, version banner removal) by the next deployment. The access-control findings — the ones with genuine HR-privacy and audit consequences — were re-confirmed still open across several redeployments and remained flagged with current evidence, so the risk register reflected reality rather than a one-time snapshot.",

    title: "Quality is assured across the lifecycle — not inspected in at the end.",
    body: "My work starts in requirement analysis: sitting with product owners and developers to clarify business rules and calculation logic, validate acceptance criteria, and flag risk areas before a line of code exists. It doesn't end at release either — I validate coverage and risk before sign-off, communicate release readiness to stakeholders, and stay accountable for what ships: on the audit-critical emissions platform I covered as sole QA, internal users contacted me directly with post-release questions, and I owned the service-update tracks that followed each major release. Testing a deployed build is one checkpoint in the middle, not the job.",
  },
  {
    title: "The best defect report is the one I never have to write.",
    body: "I don't measure myself by defects found — honestly, I'm happiest when there are none to find, because it means the early work did its job: requirements clarified, risks flagged, developers aligned before the code existed. Prevention over detection; QA owns the quality of the process, not just the testing at the end of it. When defects do surface, they ship with clean reproduction steps, expected-vs-actual, severity, and business impact — then get root-caused with developers and locked down in regression so they never come back.",
  },
  {
    title: "Risk decides what gets tested first.",
    body: "Test strategy is proactive, not reactive — it takes domain knowledge, and I keep mine sharp. On a platform whose emission results feed compliance and audits, calculation accuracy, scope-based logic, and cross-module integrations carry the most risk, so they get the deepest coverage first. Execution then earns confidence in deliberate order: sanity on the fix, smoke on the build, regression on the business-critical flows, then the full end-to-end cycle.",

  {
    title: "See the feature the way the end user will.",
    body: "Before designing a single test case, I mind-map the feature — functionality, UI elements, pass and fail paths — a habit I built at hSenid Mobile. It gives the whole team a visual of how a user will actually experience the feature, and it anchors my test design to the people we build for: functional flows, negative scenarios, edge cases, and integration points all traced from the user's view inward.",

    title: "A finding is a claim until it's reproduced.",
